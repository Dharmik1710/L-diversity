# L-diversity
Very simple algorithm

The implementation of L-diversity is done in python.

There are four parts of this algorithm

1) Read and store the data from the .data file into a python hash table with key as the attributes and their values as values from file.
2) Categories the given data into equivalent classes such  that they are l-diverse
3) Generalize the records in equivalent classes using bottum up generalizatio algorithm.
4) Store the l-diverse data in .data file.
